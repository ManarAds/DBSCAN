we attempted to group different wines using k-means, hierarchical clustering, DBSCAN.
we are managing store inventory and have received a large shipment of wine, but the brand labels fell off the bottles during transit. Fortunately, your supplier provided you with the chemical readings for each bottle along with their respective serial numbers.
Unfortunately, you aren't able to open each bottle of wine and taste test the difference â€“ you must find a way to group the unlabeled bottles back together according to their chemical readings! You know from the order list that you ordered three different types of wine and are given only two wine attributes to group the wine types back together.
Find out which clustering works best. Can you achieve as silhouette score of something better than 0.59.
